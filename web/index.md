Spiral is a modding framework that has been in development since the release of *Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc* on Steam back in 2016.

Slowly growing day by day, the vision powering Spiral would see a program that anyone could easily use to write their own killing games, using the same engine that runs *Danganronpa* itself.

Spiral offers full access to the game's scripts, which allows users to do (almost) anything they could imagine.

The *Danganronpa* games are complex and, at times, unforgiving. Many developers have worked to reverse-engineer the various formats used by the game, with varying degrees of success.

Various formats have already been documented, and some appear outside of the games which has lead to unrelated developers figuring out how they work. A special thanks to [yukinogatari](https://twitter.com/yukinogatari") from Project Zetsubou whose hard work has gotten us a long way in the world of modding the games.

            <br />
            <p><i>Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony</i> is the most recent addition to the franchise, and the most complex. The engine features virtually no carryover from the previous titles, requiring a complete rework of all elements of the game.</p>
